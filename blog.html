                <h2 class="title">My Journey to becoming a Web Developer</h2>
                <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is David Dennis, and I’m a full-time front end developer
                    with 6 months experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both as an Intern
                    and full-time position in a Fintech consulting firm.</p>
                <p>This may sound like a short time. Yes I know. Within this period I have consistently been involved in
                    building projects, work and collaborated with teams. So, it's ain't a short time to be experienced.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I have heard of stories where Developers with no Computer Science degree were doing excellently in
                    their career. I wil like to say Computer science degree is NEVER a necessity to become a good
                    Developer. Hey, It takes more than just a degree, you need to be hungry to solve problems through
                    programming or development. The degree is good in hand and you can leverage on it if you have one.
                    Also I have met Computer science graduate that have no interest in Software development. So it is
                    more about what your keen interest is in. I was such a Computer Engineer graduate that fought with
                    Software development for 4 years until I accepted to learn JavaScript. Now the rest is history.
                    <i>to be continued.</i></p>
