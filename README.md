# CS50projects


Hi, I am David Dennis. I created the website AboutMe.com based on what I have learnt through the Havard CS50 Web Programming in JavaScript and Python course on edx.org 

AboutMe.com is a simple portfolio website created for myself. The site will be updated as I keep learning through the course.

This is my project0 project.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href = "https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" >
